we can save the coordinates of every bus driver in database in firebase
and every time driver connect with internet update the new coordinates
in firebase,, and in user application when want to tracking the last
update of coordinate get from database



in register drivers activity we make a key in firebase with the name
of the company and just when we want to recall all drivers for same company



let`s remember


0 --------------> for users
1 --------------> for company
2 --------------> for driver
